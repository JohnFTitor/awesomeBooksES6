## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Setup
Clone this repo into your local device by running the following command on your Terminal:
```
git clone git@github.com:JohnFTitor/awesomeBooksES6.git
```

That will create a folder with the project inside it. Navigate into it to access the files.

Also remember to run:
```
npm install
```
This will update the dependencies and download necessary files in case you don't have them.
### Usage
Before you begin testing and experimenting, remember to use the Terminal to create a branch by running:
```
git checkout -b branch-name
```

After that you should be ready to go.
### Run tests
Before pushing changes to your branch, I would recommend opening this file:

.github/workflows/linters.yml

install and run webhint, stylelint, and eslint

These linter will help you fit your code to this repo's syntax standard.
### Deployment
Once you're done with your changes, remember to ```git pull``` before doing ```git push``` this will update 
your local copy of the project if someone else made changes to the repo while you worked on your part.
